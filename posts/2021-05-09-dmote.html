      <h1>DMOTE Build Log</h2>
      <p>After the Dactyl lost favor, I started toying around with a fork of a fork,
the Dactyl Manuform: Opposable Thumb Edition or DMOTE for short.</p>
<p>It included some interesting ideas, most notably of which is making the thumb
cluster perpendicular with the finger keys, better matching the thumbs range of
motion.</p>
<p>I also wanted to build another keyboard.</p>
<h1>Familiar Hovel; Naive Keyboard</h1>
<p>So I set out tweaking the design to my tastes, smoothing out the columns in both
the fingers and thumb keys and adding a number row. 
I also redesigned the MCU box to house an stm blue pill, expecting that any 
type of firmware that I wanted to write would support such a cheap development
board.
The MCU box redesign took a single prototype, working the first time, to my
surprise.</p>
<p>And then I contacted a friend to have it printed.</p>
<p>Then I had a bit of a pause when I waited, in vain, for the world outside my
home to calm down enough to make a trip to the office to use the lab for 
soldering feasible.</p>
<p>And such a calm time never came, and I became accustomed to the extra hour I
have every working day that used to be spent commuting.
So I bought a soldering iron and some other soldering equipment, and started to
build a bit of a lab at home.</p>
<p>I took a month or so detour to fix a bug in TFA relating to suspend on a notable
rockchip processor that plagued my Pinebook Pro.</p>
<p>Finally, I came to solder the keyboard.
It was a bear to solder, as the thumb clusters protrude from the board and offer
little room for the wires and diodes needed behind all of the keys in the 
matrix.
However, I did not need to try to solder the wires close to the board, as the
walls of the dmote allow for a bit of room for the wires.</p>
<p>So after 2 evenings of soldering, I had a keyboard half with an STM blue pill
soldered to the matricies.</p>
<p>This time the firmware was not going to be in C or C++, but Rust instead.
I quite like Rust for it's strong, expressive typing and many kinds of checks
that allow me to be more sure of the code when it compiles.
So in this project I wanted to prove, to myself mostly, that it was possible
to write firmware in Rust that would be comparable to the firmware I had 
written in the past.
Indeed, I should perhaps strive to make a firmware that is superior, as I now
have the benefit of an additional half-decade of experience since I began
writing keyboard firmware.</p>
<p>So in a single evening I wrote a new keyboard firmware in Rust that was at least
as good as the prior iterations.
It has layer support, but only one layer is defied. 
Like the M-x Butterfly's firmware, it also does not report keys any later than
after it debounces them.
I accomplished this feat in no more than 3 hours.
To my surprise, it worked correctly the first time that I was able to get it to
compile.</p>
<p>Most of this success I owe to the wonderful embedded Rust community, as my 
newest firmware makes heavy use of crates.</p>
<h1>New Territories; DMA</h1>
<p>As if to show me how thin my success truly was, I came upon a well thought out
post, in the 
<a href="https://summivox.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/keyboard-matrix-scanning-and-debouncing/">Frog in the Well blog</a>
on how keyboard scanning and debouncing are not as solved as they are commonly
thought to be.
The author of this post describes how they were able to scan the keyboard matrix
without using an CPU cycles, using DMA, and how debouncing by waiting for the
signal to be stable is not a particularly good method of estimating when a key
has been pressed, presenting a &quot;Quick-draw&quot; approach that I'm quite taken with.
I set out to implement this crazy scheme of scanning without using the CPU.</p>
<p>Implementing DMA based key scan was not as easy as its naive predecessor.</p>
<p>I had to trigger the DMA on with a timer, which is not a trigger method that the
current published version of <code>stm32f1xx_hal</code> supports, to my  knowlage.
So I threw off a layer of abstraction.
I can write to the raw registers, as I have done before in prior keyboard 
firmware.
I vendored the <code>stm32f1</code> crate, which provides register definitions, to get 
access to a new feature needed for this work: taking a raw pointer to a 
register.
Then the Rust compiler and I worked together to find a way for my firmware to
use DMA mostly safely as asking for DMA to read or write to memory is
inherently unsafe.
After the compiler and I settled on a DMA initialization function that looked to
be correct, I found out, the hard way, that having two copies of the <code>stm32f1</code>
crate is a link error.
So I vendored <code>stm32f1xx_hal</code> and updated it's dependency on <code>stm32f1</code>, which 
did not define the interrupt enum used by <code>cortex-m-rtic</code>.
So I updated <code>cortex-m-rtic</code> to a version that uses the new way to identify 
interrupts used by my vendored <code>stm32f1xx_hal</code>.</p>
<p>And finally, it compiled.</p>
<p>But I it did not work.</p>
<p>So I fired up the debugger and dumped the registers of the timer and the DMA
peripheral.
Nothing seemed off.
So I pored over the manual for the STM32F103 part that I was working with, 
looking for any clue that would break my assumptions on how the peripherals 
worked.
I found that I was enabling interrupts instead of DMA requests on the timer's
reset and compare signals.</p>
<p>After correcting that issue, my DMA interrupts were triggering, but no key 
presses would show through USB.
So I dumped the buffer that showed the key matrix output in a loop, pressing
keys.
During this I noticed something quite peculiar: when I pressed one key it
would show up in more than one row.
Not knowing what could have caused this, I again pored over the DMA section of
the manual, thinking that I had miss-configured the DMA peripheral somehow.
The initial inspiration for the fix came from the pattern of the in the columns
that the key press appeared in.
It showed up in the correct column during the first of the two buffers used by
the DMA scan.
For the heck of it, I tried changing the count I had placed into the DMA from
bytes to words.</p>
<p>Then the keyboard worked again.
But only the finger keys, as I had wired up the thumb keys as a separate matrix.</p>
<p>I got on to fixing the other count registers, as I had instructed the DMA engine
to write out of bounds, and overflowed from the matrix scan into some other 
variable.
Now that I had the DMA scan working, I began to draw up a new keyboard matrix, 
which included the thumb keys.
After laying it out in a nice 6 column by 9 row design, I wrote up the key map.
When going over the key map for the third time, I noticed that there was a gap
of unconnected keys in the matrix between the finger and thumb keys.
So I removed a row from the matrix, bringing it to a 6 column, 8 row design.
Then I soldered this into position, and updated the code to match.</p>
<p>The thumb keys worked.</p>
<h1>Warm Tent; Fruitful Expedition</h1>
<p>I soldered the right half over the next few evenings, and wrote up a key map for
it.
I could finally start typing on the keyboard, so long as I was okay with it 
showing up as two keyboards through USB.</p>
<p>At this point I stopped building the DMOTE for a bit to type on it, looking for
any mechanical improvements.
I found that it was a bit wobbly, and would slide around on my keyboard tray.
So I connected the keyboards with K'Nex, which reduced the sliding but did not 
prevent it entirely.</p>
<p>After a few days of typing on it in this state, I had a great idea for a pair
of 4-bar linkages, made of K'Nex, that would allow for an adjustable tenting 
angle.
Not eager to take my new keyboard out of commission immediately, as I was 
working at the time, I put off rebuilding the base to the weekend.
That weekend I spent much time snapping K'Nex into place to construct a tenting
that was good.
I started with a 45 degree tent, as that was easy to do.
I really liked the 45 degree tent, and wondered if an even taller angle would
yield even better results.
As my tent angle was controlled by the length of a single member of the 
keyboard stand, I changed it's length to be shorter, and liked the results.
I later computed that this new stand is at a 70 degree angle.</p>
<p>Having the tenting angle under control, over the next few days I made incremental
improvements to the structure for the sake of rigidity and preventing the 
keyboard from slipping off.
I ended up with a design that uses no tape, or anything like it, fastening with
twisty ties (the bailing wire of electrical engineering).</p>
<p>Now I typed on my new DMOTE for a week or so, noting any further problems as
they arose.
Noticing nothing, and having just bought a multi-meter, I decided it was now
best to begin working on having the two keyboards appear as one.</p>
<p>I soldered the RJ9 jacks into both MCUs and tested continuity between the hands
with a red, coiled RJ9 cable plugged in.
Both sides seemed wired correctly, and I was confidant that it would not short
when plugged into the computer.
I did not short when plugged in.</p>
<p>Now I had all of the hardware that I needed to get the hands talking, and 
combine the two keyboards into a single one, like many of other keyboards.
I pulled in the <code>packed_struct</code> crate, and got to work defining a single, shared
structure to pass across the wire.
I then separated the firmware into two binaries, as the left and right firmware
now had little in common.</p>
<p>I flashed the firmware, and things worked as I expected.
Again, I used the keyboard for a week, noting any issues that arose.
This time, I noticed that under intense typing, the left keyboard would lock
up.
It was pretty reliable to reproduce, as you could get it to lock up by typing
gibberish as fast as possible for no more than 20 seconds.
Since it was easy to reproduce, I wrote down the issue, reset the left keyboard
when it happened, and waited until the weekend to fix it, as I had more 
pressing things to do.</p>
<p>On the weekend, I hooked up the debugger and hammered on the keyboard, 
reproducing the bug.
As I had suspected, the bug was an <code>unwrap</code> in the left firmware that was used
in place of blocking on sending over the UART.
This assertion would only trigger if you tried to send two press/release 
signals in the same 200us, a single scan cycle.</p>
<p>I first tried increasing the baud rate of serial above the 115,200 bps that I
used.
Increasing the baud rate much past 250,000 bps caused issues with the 
reliability of the transmission, so I kept the baud rate at the lower, standard
115,200 bps to avoid these issues.</p>
<p>Seeing that blocking was needed, I did some math to determine the expected 
latency increase from blocking in the interrupt handler.
Expecting that I could manage to hit a key with every finger of my hand at the 
exact same time would add approximately an additional 250us to the latency for
the keys from the left side, exactly once, after debouncing.
I deemed this an acceptable latency degradation, considering that my debouncer
eats 5ms, or 5000us, of time to figure out if the keys have been pressed, 
making this 250us feel small by comparison.
I may revisit this later, if I can significantly reduce or remove the latency
caused by the debouncer.
Unlike its right hand brother, the left keyboard only debounces and sends over
UART, so any blocking would not be an issue.
Further, my DMOTE uses the USB boot protocol, so typing more than 6 non-modifier
keys at the same time results in an error.
I opted to block on sending, leaving anything with DMA or queues for another 
time.</p>
<p>I have not had any issues with the blocking, and have not been able to notice
any issues.</p>
<h1>Outer Steps; Schmitt triggers</h1>
<p>About 2 weeks later, I embarked on a journey to implement the Quick Draw style
debouncer. Starting with the hardest part first, I wrote up an implementation
of the state machine that would be required. Then I wrote the documentation,
including many state diagrams, starting with the most naive implementation and
moving to a more and more simplified state machine. After having written this
documentation, and without running any of this code, I noticed a bug, where I
had swapped the event emitting and non-emitting bouncing to stable transitions.
I then spent some time discussing with the Rust compiler about how best this
could be integrated with the rest of the keyboard.
Once it compiled, I flashed it and then could not type.</p>
<p>I whipped out my kinesis advantage, and dropped into gdb, debugging my keyboard
using my other keyboard.
I narrowed my bug down by dumping the DMA buffers; I had not somehow messed up
DMA scan.
Then I noticed that the key column #0 worked.
After trying many avenues of debugging, I eventually found out that I had
forgotten to reset a loop counter in an iterator, making the iterator skip all
but the first column of keys.</p>
<p>With this bug out of the way, I flashed new keyboard firmware and got to
typing.
I did not notice much of a difference between the no-delay debounce and the
traditional debounce, but hey, it was mostly about the journey and the docs we
created along the way.</p>
<h1>New Home; Thoughts</h1>
<p>I have come out of this journey with a new appreciation for the Rust Embedded
Ecosystem and the Big Theory Statement.
The Rust embedded ecosystem is full of so many smart folks working on making
things easy to get small.
I have an easier time making a small, effective binary with embedded Rust than
I have ever had writing C.</p>
<p>The Big Theory Statement, in retrospect, is something I need to do much more
frequently.
I have always had difficulty jumping into a code base and figuring out what
each file or directory's responsibility is.
With Rust, it's possible to phrase these statements as module or struct 
documentation.
This, I feel, is a big win.
Having now written a few of these Big Theory Statements, I can attest that
these statements help you think about how your code is supposed to work, and
you can refer back to them within comments in the code, pointing out any thing
that looks surprising and justifying the deviation from expectation with the 
theory above it.</p>
<p>This new keyboard is very nice to type on.
I'm not yet as fast at typing on it as I am some of my other keyboards.
I don't think that anything inherent in the design is holding me back; I think
that practice will mitigate those differences.</p>
<p>I'll be typing on this keyboard for the foreseeable future.</p>
